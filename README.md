# order-robots-from-RobotSpareBin
I have developed a robot which can order the robots from RobotSpareBin website.
The robot should use the orders file (.csv ) and complete all the orders in the file.
Only the robot is allowed to get the orders file. You may not save the file manually on your computer.
The robot should save each order HTML receipt as a PDF file.
The robot should save a screenshot of each of the ordered robots.
The robot should embed the screenshot of the robot to the PDF receipt.
The robot should create a ZIP archive of the PDF receipts (one zip archive that contains all the PDF files). Store the archive in the output directory.
The robot should complete all the orders even when there are technical failures with the robot order website.
